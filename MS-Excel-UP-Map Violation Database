## Key Features  

### **Data Management and Validation**  
- **Data Validation**: Ensures only accurate and consistent data is entered.  
- **Consolidated Data Sources**: Integrates inputs from various platforms, including:  
  - Price Spider/Prowl  
  - Keepa  
  - Salsify  
  - SAP (Stop Ship)  
  - Microsoft Office Email  

### **Data Organization and Analysis**  
- **Sorted and Filtered Columns**:  
  - Sorted by **SKU/Catalog #** (Column H) and **SAP Name** (Column T).  
  - Filtered by **Filter Status** (Column F) to focus on "Currently Monitoring" entries and the previous two weeks of data.  
  - Enables regional business units (rBUs) to review 2â€“3 weeks of data, provide feedback, and decide on stop ship actions.  
- **Domain Tracking**:  
  - Added a "Domain" column (Column AA) to identify seller listing domains and track violation sources.  
- **Pivot Tables**:  
  - Created for visualizing sales trends by region, product, and other metrics.  

### **Usability Enhancements**  
- **Grouped Columns**: Ensures all columns fit on one page for easier viewing on laptops.  
- **Froze Panes**: Allows smooth navigation across rows and columns, especially on the right side or bottom of the file.  
- **Color Coding**: Applied to columns and rows for better readability and human visibility.  
- **Additional Columns**:  
  - Added "PUP 1 Price," "PUP 1 Start Date," and "PUP 1 End Date" columns to verify whether seller listings are in violation or aligned with promotional periods.  

### **Collaborative Workflow**  
- **Tabs for Teams**:  
  - **Customer Service Tab**:  
    - Duplicated and exported as a separate file for the customer service team to manage stop ships.  
  - **Manual Email Tab**:  
    - Filtered to specific requirements for external communications.  
    - Enables sending Non-Acquiescence Emails, Stop Ship Removal notices, or Stop Ship Additions.  
- **Centralized File Management**:  
  - Transitioned files to Microsoft SharePoint for a single, accessible source of truth.  
  - Eliminated confusion caused by multiple, outdated files shared via email.
