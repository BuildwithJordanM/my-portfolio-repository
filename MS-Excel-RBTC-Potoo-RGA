#I have created a Microsoft Excel Potoo RGA template, replacing an outdated version that was no longer suitable for our needs.
##This new version is plug and play, which has a areas that need to be populated and then the file can be exported to a PDF.
##This file also has the print areas included to the right dimensions.
##Robert Bosch Tool Corporation.
##The original RGA was a warranty Microsoft Excel file that was used for RGA Mystery Puchases (Potoo Mystery Buy Program RGA).
##There were several columns and rows with information and details that were not needed for this Unilateral Pricing Program RGA Mystery Buy Program for unauthorized sellers.
##The revised file is cleaner and simplistic.
##On the revised version, there are only (2) tabs compared to the previous file with (4) tabs.
##Added additional columns that are related to the ASIN and SKU for the Mystery Buy, examples are Seller ID, Seller Name, Image Links, Order ID, and more.
##Make changes to Column M and it will reflect on both tabs.
##There are formulas setup in the revised file that will auto-update.
