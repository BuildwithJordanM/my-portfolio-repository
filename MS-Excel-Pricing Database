# Microsoft Excel Pricing Database Project  

## Overview  
While working in pricing operations, I identified inefficiencies in how quotes were being managed.  
Quotes were tracked individually, with limited visibility and no centralized system.  
To address this, I proposed and developed a **Pricing Database** to streamline and standardize the quoting process, ensuring comprehensive data tracking and improved decision-making.  

After analyzing two years of quote data and presenting the database to key decision-makers, incorporating feedback, the project was approved and adopted as the new standard.

## Database Features  
The **Pricing Database** (MasterQuoteAnalysis) was designed with several key features:  

### Quote Management  
- **Approval Workflow**:  
   - Tracks team members involved in quoting.  
   - Multi-level approval process involving pricing and finance teams.  

- **Detailed Quote Information**:  
   - References to previous and new quotes.  
   - Quote classification: One-time or Blanket (Annual).  
   - CRM tracking ID for reference.  
   - Quote status: No Access, Pending, Quoted.  
   - Automatic calculation of CRM ticket completion times.  

### Customer and Vendor Details  
- **Customer Information**:  
   - Account number, Name, Group Code, Price Level, Payment Terms.  
   - Sales representative details: Contact Name, Email, and Job Title.  

- **Vendor Sourcing Tab**:  
   - Tracks vendor product costs that are not included in standard price files.  
   - Captures vendor-specific pricing based on sales rep requests and purchasing team discussions.  

### Pricing and Cost Calculations  
- **Data Integration**:  
   - Integrated invoice and sales data for analysis.  
   - Used **VLOOKUP** to match product costs by vendor, factoring in requested sales rep quantities.  

- **Cost and Margin Analysis**:  
   - SKU/item details and descriptions.  
   - Freight costs, core charges, minimum order quantities (MOQ), and other fees.  
   - Material margin analysis: Historical and current, rolling 12-month metrics, and target margins.  
   - Pricing breakdown: Offer prices, margins, and total values calculated for each SKU.

## Reporting and Metrics  
The **Pricing Database** included interconnected tabs that fed into one another to generate insightful metrics and reports. A dedicated tab, **ExcelQuoteMetrics**, provided tools for advanced reporting:  

1. **Performance Tracking**:  
   - Status of quotes: Won, Lost, Pending, or Partial (winning one or more SKUs in a multi-SKU quote).  
   - Total opportunities tracked by dollar value and percentage.  

2. **Visualization Tools**:  
   - Microsoft Excel Pivot Tables for in-depth analysis.  
   - Pie charts for visualizing:  
     - Quote outcomes (Won/Lost/Partial).  
     - Time taken to complete CRM ticket requests.  
     - Number of SKUs/items per quote.  

3. **Key Metrics**:  
   - SKU/item counts for each status category.  
   - Contribution analysis by dollar value and percentage.  
   - Material margin comparisons and performance trends.

## Impact  
The **Pricing Database** revolutionized quote management by:  
- **Centralizing Data**: Unified all quoting information into a single system with interconnected tabs feeding data into summary metrics.  
- **Enhancing Vendor Collaboration**: Facilitated vendor negotiations for non-standard pricing and integrated those costs seamlessly into the database.  
- **Improving Decision-Making**: Provided real-time insights through invoice data, material margin tracking, and performance metrics.  
- **Streamlining Processes**: Automated calculations and workflows reduced manual effort and minimized errors.  

By standardizing quote tracking and enabling data-driven decision-making, this project significantly optimized pricing operations and established a scalable foundation for future strategy improvements.
