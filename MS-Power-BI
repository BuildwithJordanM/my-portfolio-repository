# MS-Power-BI Repository  

Welcome to the **Microsoft Power BI Dashboard Repository**, a collection of **data visualizations** designed to analyze and track key compliance metrics. This repository highlights dashboards that provide **actionable insights** for monitoring trends, identifying patterns, and supporting **data-driven decisions**.  

---

## **Purpose**  
This repository was created to showcase **Microsoft Power BI dashboards** featuring **various visualization types**, including **line graphs, bar graphs, and stacked graphs**. These dashboards are designed to **display and analyze compliance-related data** across multiple dimensions and categories.

## **Key Dashboards and Metrics**  

### **1. Count of Compliance Issues by Month-Year and Business Unit**  
- Visualizes the number of compliance cases (`Yes`/`No`) over time, segmented by business units.  
- Helps track policy trends and identify areas needing improvement.  

### **2. Count of Compliance Issues by Month-Year and Compliance Action Feedback**  
- Displays compliance cases (`Yes`/`No`) alongside **compliance action statuses** (e.g., "Reviewed," "Pending").  
- Provides insights into the impact of compliance measures.  

### **3. Count of Compliance Issues by Month-Year and Data Source**  
- Breaks down compliance cases by **internal and external data sources** for each month-year.  
- Highlights which sources contribute most to compliance tracking.  

### **4. Count of Compliance Issues by Month-Year and Domain**  
- Tracks compliance issues over time by **source domains**.  
- Useful for identifying patterns in **compliance monitoring**.  

### **5. Count of Compliance Issues by System Reference Name**  
- Summarizes compliance cases (`Yes`/`No`) associated with each **system reference name**.  
- Helps identify recurring issues tied to **specific data entries**.  

### **6. Count of Compliance Issues by Month-Year and Compliance Notification Status**  
- Displays compliance issues by the status of **policy notifications** (e.g., "Sent" or "N/A").  
- Highlights the relationship between **email communication** and **compliance monitoring**.  

### **7. Count of Compliance Issues by SKU and Policy Status**  
- Breaks down compliance cases (`Yes`/`No`) by **SKU numbers**.  
- Allows for **SKU-level monitoring** of compliance and policy adherence.
