#Created groups/people within Microsoft Office Email for daily price hold reports and the Unilateral Pricing Program. This allowed me to email people without having to remember who need to be added to emails, versus copying emails from a template or searching for these contacts each time.
##By creating these groups/people, this assisted with sending manual email notices to sellers who violated Robert Bosch Tool Corporation Unilateral Pricing Program. Previously, I had to type these seller, rBUs, and sales team member email addresses each time.
