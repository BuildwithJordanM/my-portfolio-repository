# Microsoft Outlook Email Groups for Automated Communication  

## Overview  
To streamline the communication process for **Robert Bosch Tool Corporation's Unilateral Pricing Program (UP/UPP)**, I created dedicated email groups and contact lists within **Microsoft Office Email**. This initiative reduced manual effort, improved efficiency, and ensured consistent communication with stakeholders regarding:  
- **Daily Price Hold Reports**  
- **Bi-Weekly Non-Acquiescence Violation Notices**  
- **Stop Ship Additions and Removals**

## Key Challenges Before Implementation  
1. **Manual Email Management**:  
   - Each email required manually typing or copying/pasting addresses for sellers, rBUs, and sales team members.  
   - Time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when managing multiple stakeholders.  
2. **Inconsistent Communication**:  
   - High risk of overlooking recipients or using outdated contact information.

     - Sales team members and other key stakeholders.  
2. **Standardized Processes**:
