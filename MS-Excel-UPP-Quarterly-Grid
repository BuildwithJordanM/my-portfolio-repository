# 2024 Q1 Unilateral Pricing Program (UPP/UP) Grid Template Revamp  

## Overview  
In preparation for the 2024 Q1 Unilateral Pricing Program (UPP/UP) grid, I reviewed the existing template and identified opportunities to improve usability and clarity for sellers, employees, and business unit representatives (rBUs). After presenting my suggestions to the rBUs and receiving approval, I implemented significant revisions to simplify and enhance the template.

## Key Improvements  

### Simplification of Data Presentation  
- **Change Type Column**:  
  - Introduced a new "Change Type" column to track modifications, such as removed items, promotional timing, and product updates.  
  - Eliminated the need for separate rows or tabs for these changes, streamlining the "Consolidated" and individual business unit tabs.  

- **Consolidated Data**:  
  - The "Change Type" column now feeds directly into the **UP Grid Consolidated Tab**, providing a centralized view of all changes.

### Enhanced Usability  
- **Grouped Columns**:  
  - Grouped all columns related to promotional details, including:  
    - PUP 2 and PUP 3 prices.  
    - PUP 2 and PUP 3 start and end dates.  
  - This ensures a cleaner layout and better organization for users.

- **Improved Formatting**:  
  - Adjusted font type and size for better readability.  
  - Standardized the layout for consistency across tabs.  

- **Zoom Adjustment**:  
  - Set the zoom level to 80% for easier navigation and a comprehensive view of the data.

### Streamlined Collaboration  
- **Microsoft SharePoint Integration**:  
  - Made the updated file shareable to all business unit leaders via **Microsoft SharePoint**.  
  - This eliminated the need to send multiple files back and forth, as was common in previous years and processes.  
  - The centralized file ensured all stakeholders could access the latest version in real-time, reducing confusion and enhancing efficiency.

## Impact  
The revamped UPP/UP grid template offers:  
- **Improved Clarity**: Users can quickly identify changes and updates via the "Change Type" column.  
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Centralized and consolidated data reduces the need to navigate multiple tabs for information.  
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Formatting and zoom adjustments make the template more accessible and user-friendly.  
- **Better Collaboration**: SharePoint integration ensured seamless access for all business unit leaders, fostering real-time updates and reducing redundant communication.  

By making these improvements, the updated UPP/UP grid aligns with the goal of simplifying processes while maintaining accuracy and transparency across all stakeholders.
